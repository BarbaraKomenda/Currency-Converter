# Currency Converter

As part of my homework on the Frontend Developer course on the **youcode platform**, I created a currency converter. The user can check the *Polish* *Zloty* exchange rate against three currencies: *Euro*, *Swiss Franc* and *British Pound*.

**You can check it here**: [Currency Converter](https://barbarakomenda.github.io/currency-converter/)

## To create this converter I used the following technologies:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Java Script
4. BEM
5. Open Graph
